#Important Notes

Each and Every code in the jupyter file is based on pure handwritten code and proper analysis was done.

This entire repository marks the start of our Machine Learning journey back in 2023/2024.

We were advised to code without any help of AI tools and any sort of machine learning libraries.

If you plan to start your machine learning journey you can view through these codes and learn them.

We are grateful to Dr. Shafin Rahman sir for guiding us through the machine learning practices and making us stay upto date with the current trends. 

In code collaboration with Munem Shahriar & Dr. Shafin Rahman.
